          couples who are many years apart in age and those that are closer in
          age in terms of marital status. Couples with similar ages lie more
          closely along the diagonal.

          However, those who find their relationships excellent tend to have sex
          3-6 times a week, with once a month or less coming second. Select a scale basis from the drop-down:
          the default "overall data" selection will scale the chart over all responses. When you select the scale based on the frequency
          categories, you will find that the respondents tend to rate their relationships as excellent. Then, when you
          select the scale based on the quality categories, you'll see that there is a high amount of respondents
          who have sex once a month or less.

            frequency of more than twice a week.

          One couple dated for thirty some years before finally getting married,
          but most other couples did not take nearly as long. Another couple
          went through meeting each other and getting married within a year. On
          average we see that most respondents dated for less than 6 years
          before getting married.
